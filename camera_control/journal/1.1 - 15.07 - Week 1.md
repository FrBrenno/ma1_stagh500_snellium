> Camera Control System

- **Industrial** : Formal and Professional system
- **Plug-and-Play** : should be automatically configured and easy to install
- **Software Triggering** : image acquisition should be trigger by software as opposed to actual implementation, pushing button to close circuit sending signal.

Cameras has two ports: 
- USB : for data acquisition
- 6-pin port : for triggering

They may change data acquisition port to Ethernet cables because USB has certain limits, physical limits (3 meters long).

They may put in place a _switch to manage triggering_ => research solution.

# Research Notes

[[Francesco_Adamo_et_al_2009.pdf]]: 
- The camera receives the trigger signal by one of the motor controllers and they acquire synchronized images.
	- The motor controller is basically a micro-controller
	- Images are obtained by hardware triggering
- Timing of trigger signal is controllable by means of a dedicated command of the motor controller.
	- Micro-controller manages the trigger signal
- Acquired image are buffered by software running on PC, and then they are processed asynchronously
	- First idea of the system:
		- PC sends signal to triggering unit
		- Triggering unit receives signal and send hardware signal to cameras
		- The next step is not explicit because data could be sent to the micro-controller in order to buffer it and then send to PC or data could be directly sent to PC where the main application manages the data reception.


## Ideas of system architecture

### Current

A button closes the circuit inside the micro-controller 
Micro-controller sends the trigger signal to the camera. 
Cameras simultaneous take the picture (hardware trigger)
Cameras send the data to the PC through their USB port. 

### First Idea

PC sends the trigger signal to micro-controller and waits
Micro-controller send trigger signal to cameras
Cameras simultaneous take the picture (hardware trigger)
Cameras simultaneous send directly to the PC through USB

### Second Idea

PC send the trigger signal to micro-controller and waits
Micro-controller send trigger signal to cameras
Cameras simultaneous take the picture (hardware trigger)
Cameras sends data to micro-controller that is used as a buffer
Micro-controller sends image data, one at a time, to PC application which resume execution.

### Third Idea (WLODARCZYK M. approach)
