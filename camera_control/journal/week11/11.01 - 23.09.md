# Week Planning

![Week 11 Gantt Diagram](img/week_11_gantt.png)

- microcontroller-virtual has to be finished monday
- microcontroller-virtual treated during the week
- microcontroller-serial implementation was postponed to this week
- microcontroller firmware needs to be refactored this week

- Merge request of microcontroller-serial and microcontroller firmware are to be done next week
- System setup, housing, testing and debug also should be done next week.

I am going to work in several tasks at the same time this week. My separation of time will be morning and afternoon. For example, I will work on microcontroller firmware during morning and on software implementation during afternoon. Like this i could keep a regular and equal pace in both domains.
