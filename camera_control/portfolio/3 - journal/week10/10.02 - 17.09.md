# 10.02 - 17.09

## Today's Plan

- [ ] Virtual microcontroller plan, running and tested
	- [x] add-virtual handler
	- [x] remove-virtual handler
	- [x] serializers_microcontroller
	- [ ] snelliumd arguments
	- [ ] solve bug of device_identifier name
	- [ ] more microcontroller handlers
	- [ ] unit testing module
- [x] Single thread for discovery of devices


# Notes

The day was productive. I could advance a lot in the project by doing the single thread and continuing the virtual microcontroller. Also, I did a lot of personal stuff like planning meetings for my master's thesis subject, new job and mid-term visit.
