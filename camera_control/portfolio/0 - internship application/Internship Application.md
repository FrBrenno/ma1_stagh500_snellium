Before beginning my search for an internship, I needed to decide which domain I wanted to work in, and which would provide the most realistic experience for my future career. I decided that :
- I should work on my domain of study;
	- embedded system or computer science
- My project has a meaning for the company and be relevant;
- My project should be exciting and interesting at my point of view;

I started by ruling out consulting firms. These companies often don't offer specific missions or projects, as they exist to serve their clients. This means I could be assigned to any random project at any company. Additionally, I wanted to focus on my field of study which is a specialised domain with specific demands. I felt that consulting firms might not offer the precise experience I was looking for.

Consequently, I began searching for internships in embedded systems engineering. However, since it is a niche field, finding suitable opportunities was challenging, and many of the internships I found were located too far away. As my search progressed, I gradually loose my criteria, starting with "Embedded Systems Intern," moving to "Embedded Software Intern," and eventually widening it to "Computer Science Engineering."

The search process was not easy. Over two months, I applied to 12 companies that I found interesting. Unfortunately, only a few responded, and I ended up with just two interview opportunities—one with Easics, a microchip design company based in Leuven, and the other with Snellium, a startup developing optical inspection technologies for quality control in glass manufacturing based in Anderlecht. I encountered Easics at the `ULB job fair`, while I found Snellium's internship offer on the `Student.be` website.

Both companies seemed like great opportunities, but the nature of the projects became the deciding factor. At Easics, the project involved developing a tool for hardware verification by coding a System-C-like language using Python syntax, which they called System-Py. While this was an interesting project, the idea of spending my time solely developing a tool—a plugin for their software—did not align with my expectations. I wanted to work on something directly related to my field of study, and while the project was important for the company, it didn’t feel as impactful as the project at Snellium.

In contrast, the project at Snellium was well-aligned with my interests. It involved designing a control module operated by a microcontroller and refactoring their codebase to support this new feature. This work was critical for their product, as it would automate camera triggering, which was previously done manually with the help of a button. The new control module would allow the software to send a signal to the control unit to trigger the cameras, making the process automatic and synchronised with the software pipeline.

In the end, I chose Snellium for my internship, and they were happy to welcome me to their team.

# Snellium Application Process

The application process at Snellium was straightforward.

After submitting my CV via Student.be, Vincent, the CTO of the company and my future supervisor, contacted me the day after my submission. He requested a motivation letter, as it had been missing from my initial application. Once he received the letter, he informed me that there was a match between my expectations and one of their projects.

We then scheduled an online meeting to get to know each other better, followed by an on-site visit where Vincent presented the lab and provided a more detailed overview of the project. During the visit, I also completed a technical test focused on image processing, which allowed me to showcase my technical skills relevant to their work.

Overall, it was a smooth and fast process. Their presentation, along with the project itself, convinced me that this internship would be an exciting opportunity to undertake.
