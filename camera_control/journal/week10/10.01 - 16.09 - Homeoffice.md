- [x] Rapport week 9
- [x] Reschedule mid-term visit
- [x] Send my schedule to time2code

# Device module

I finished the code but it was not compiling because some tests were not passing. After investigating it, I discovered that one condition in the connect to device method was wrong and thus, always false. No device put in the device set.

After that, I needed to rebase my code with `microcontroller-develop` branch. I almost lost all my progress because git tools are not very explanatory and forced me to check every single commit I have (144 in total). I lost changes in 4 files by overlooking it. Fortunately, I could come back in the git history and re-establish the files.

The merge request passed the pipelines and i am waiting for the revision.

However, I have forgot to refactor the thread class. Currently there are two threads running, one for cameras and one for microcontrollers. Vincent asked me for refactor it to only use one single thread that takes care of everything.
