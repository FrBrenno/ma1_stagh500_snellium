## Planning

![[img/week_8_gantt.png]]

Aujourd'hui, je dois absolument avoir finir le module device pour ne pas être en retard pour la fin de mon projet. Alors, je dois réviser la courante implémentation et la soumettre en révision par mon maître de stage.

## Device Module

I was able to refactor the code of device and discoverer sets so it only deal with interface. Code built but tests are broken.

I could finish today because I had a special fast task that appeared.
I need to implement my system in one prototype of their machine for one conference next month. It took me 3 hours to refactor my python prototype, microcontrollers firmware and create a script for running it. 
I felt lot of pressure but as the project is already working, I only had to debug and refactor. The code was compressed and sent by .zip file to my supervisor which approved my software and even told me that i did a few too much on it, just because i took care of error cases and avoid errors traceback logs.
