# Presentation of the Company

<div style="text-align:center"> <h1>SNELLIUM</h1> <p>Innovative Solutions for Optical Inspections</p> </div>

Snellium is a startup and a spin-off from ULB, founded in 2021. It operates as an R&D company focused on developing **optical inspection systems** for quality control in industries like automotive and aerospace.

## History 

The CEO, Wassilis Tzevelecos, initially developed a technology during his PhD to measure the shape of water droplets in zero gravity. When launching the spin-off, he aimed to apply this technology to glass inspection. However, after Vincent van Pelt (CTO) joined, the project shifted focus, and the original patent that Wassilis created along ULB was never used. Later, Abbas Lakkis came aboard as CPO, bringing additional expertise to the team. Wassilis oversees the scientific and business aspects, Vincent manages software projects, and Abbas coordinates mechanical designs.

Currently, the company has six full-time employees, including the founders, along with students working on relevant sub-projects. Snellium welcomes interns, each taking charge of a significant part of a larger project.

## Business

Snellium's business is primarily **Research & Development**. According to a conversation with the CEO, the company doesn't work on specific projects but rather implements its technology to meet client needs. Clients approach Snellium for solutions to their quality control challenges, and the team conducts feasibility studies before signing contracts for implementation.

The company owns its technology, and once a project is delivered, it is installed at the client's site, with ongoing maintenance provided. Clients pay royalties for the continued use of the technology. Snellium's revenue comes from regional government subsidies, development contracts, and royalties.

The primary industry they serve is automotive, although the technology has potential applications in other sectors, such as glass for mobile phones, watches, and buildings. The automotive industry is a key focus because manufacturers are eager to replace outdated systems and accelerate processes. For example, the current method for profiling windshields involves a mechanical system using pistons, which must be calibrated with an expensive template. This process is costly, time-consuming, and prone to wear and tear. Snellium's technology offers a more efficient solution.

## Technology

Snellium’s technology is based on **stereo-deflectometry**:
A pattern is projected onto the object using a speckle pattern light source, and images are captured by several cameras positioned in different angles. The object's shape is reconstructed and compared to the nominal CAD model to detect deformations or defects.

Although the system does require calibration, it is a general calibration independent of specific objects, meaning the same setup can be used for different models of windshields, for example. The size of the machine is dictated by the size of the object it inspects—while the setup for windshields is large, smaller machines are used for items like phone screens or watch glass.

Snellium's approach eliminates the need for physical templates and pistons. The system is entirely optical, with image data processed by computer vision algorithms, delivering quick and precise results. This method is cheaper, faster, and requires less maintenance than traditional systems.
