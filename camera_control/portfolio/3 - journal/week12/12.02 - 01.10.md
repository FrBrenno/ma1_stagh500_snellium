# Today's Plan

- [x] Implementation : microcontroller-serial
	- [x] Debug communication problems
	- [x] Get info of microcontroller on Serial creation
- [ ] Documentation : microcontroller-serial
- [x] Merge Request : microcontroller-serial
	- Tuesday
	- worst-case : Wednesday

I finished implementing all the serial-microcontroller module. When testing i got a sending-receiving error that cost me a lot of time and i made the microcontroller's code a pretty mess. At the end, it was the Arduino AutoReset that was causing the arduino to reboot and not acquiring the sending message.

In order to solve it we should manipulate the arduino board to avoid the reboot. It happens anytime the software opens the port to communication with the arduino and takes around 1.7 seconds.
