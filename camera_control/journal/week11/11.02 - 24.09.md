# Today's Plan

- [ ] microcontroller-virtual
	- [x] request: /microcontroller/{id}/cameras/update
	- [x] request: rename trigger command to software_trigger
	- [x] request: cameras/{id}/hardware_trigger
	- [x] request: cameras/hardware_trigger
		- [x] check cameras parameters: trigger mode, line, ...
		- [x] if bad, update it
		- [x] set single_image_acquisition
		- [x] execute command on microcontroller
	- [x] unit testing
	- [ ] rebase and merge

# Notes

I did all important common request handler of microcontroller.
I setup testing of this handler to test the good execution of the virtual microcontroller and the request handlers. Everything is working fine.

However, pipeline did not passed so i will debug it tomorrow.
