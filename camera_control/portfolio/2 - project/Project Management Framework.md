# Project Management Framework

Snellium did not impose a strict project management framework on me. Their key expectations were simple:

- Maintain a steady pace of progress.
- Ensure clear communication on the project's status.
	- With a stand-up meeting every single morning.

They provided project management tools through the **NextCloud** environment, which offered features like *Kanban boards*, calendars, email, and documents integration. Of these, I mainly used the Kanban board to manage ongoing tasks. At the start of each phase, I would break down the work into tasks and categorize them as "To Do," "Doing," and "Done." This method gave me clear direction and helped structure my progress.

For this project, I worked in **phases**, as outlined in the document [Project Tasks & Planning](./Project%20Tasks%20&%20Planning.md).

## Project Workflow

At the beginning of each week, I set clear goals for what needed to be accomplished by week's end. Similarly, each morning, I created a **To Do list** and worked through the tasks in order. This structured workflow is reflected in my journal. At the end of the week, or the start of the following week, I would review my journal to identify important tasks and events. This helped me prepare my weekly report. During this review, I would also trace any unfinished tasks and plan new ones.

In the early stages, I was too excited to dive into the project and didnâ€™t plan my work properly. I would simply note down immediate tasks within the context I was working in. However, as the project progressed and tasks such as microcontroller code and software development became parallelizable, I recognized the need for better structure. Even so, I was only thinking two to three weeks ahead.

Now, with the internship nearing its end, I have a complete plan for the remainder of the project. I realize that to deliver a strong final product, I need to increase my pace, manage my time effectively, and remain focused during this critical rush phase.
