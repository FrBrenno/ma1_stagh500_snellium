# Today's Plan

- [ ] Separate monitor class into interface and API
	- [ ] pyudev functions all together in one single function
- [ ] Separate connection class into interface and API
	- [ ] uC communication tx,rx functions in one class
	- [ ] all function that uses a library in a specific class
- [ ] Trigger camera thanks to Renesas board
- [ ] Design Review

# Architecture Refactoring

The idea is to have functions that interact with libraries, that are platform oriented, in a specific class. This will allow modularity and cross-compatibility.
