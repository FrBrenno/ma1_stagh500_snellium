Hello Mr Quitin,

I hope you are doing well.

I am contacting you to provide a weekly update of my internship which has started last week. I am not really sure about the format and the content of this email, but I try to explain in a concise way. Please, let me know if you have a preferred format. I remember that you showed me once an example of it, it would be great if you could send it to me.

I am doing my internship in a spin-off start-up from ULB called Snellium. They have an optical technology which is used to make quality control in transparent or reflective elements such as glasses for cars, watches, mobile phones, etc... or paintings. They implement this technology for each client adapting the method to the environment or the kind of object to control.

My project here is to implement a camera control unit which is basically a microcontroller-based system that should manage camera triggering. So, this week my job was first to do research on camera control system and simultaneous triggering of multiple cameras. I spent two days on it. The challenge of the research consisted in finding the right keywords and finding articles that would explicitly describe their hardware, because most of article were software/method oriented. At the end of the second day, I found three great articles that well described the hardware and was pretty relevant to my project.

After this finding, they asked me to find a microcontroller board to buy and any component I would need. The task was pretty hard and very vague since I didn't have a lot of criteria. The first day consisted in defining criteria to narrow down the choices of microcontroller because there is an overwhelming number of series, architecture and models to choose. The only requirements there was at the beginning was a high number of ports, so multiple motor (a future project) can be connected to the control unit; a high clock frequency, in order to have a powerful microcontroller; availability and short lead time, so they can get the microcontroller as soon as possible; and at last, the possibility to implement new features in the future. Then, I spent the rest of the week updating criteria, introducing new one, making research and looking to online distributors for a microcontroller board that could help.Â 

My project itself does not need a very powerful microcontroller to work, since the simultaneous triggering of cameras is done through hardware trigger. The main challenge was to find a microcontroller good enough to support more advanced features in the future which I don't know the requirements and specifications. Also, the requirements for an industrial-oriented microcontroller with long reliability and high availability were really difficult to meet. After, fixing a lot of parameters and a long time of research, I finally found a microcontroller board that satisfied all criteria, was well-documented and had a nice support and community.

The work environment is pretty calm. During work hours, everybody is focus on their own projects and nobody talks, except when they need to discuss with the technical director. During lunch, we talk to each other a little, but the communication is very shy, I think it is because the majority of working people are interns. Most of the time, the directors talk more, and we listen to them. Despite that, everybody is welcoming and friendly. They help each other and the team is pretty multi-disciplinary, in computer science domain of course.

I think I am finally hands-on the domain I would like to work, and the internship has already presented me responsibilities and challenges of my future occupation. I have learnt that every choice should be justifiable and that not only technical aspect of components should be taken into account when buying electronics, logistics and manufacturer also matters a lot.

This is it for last week. Let me know if my update is what you expect or not.

Best regards,  
Brenno Ferreira.
