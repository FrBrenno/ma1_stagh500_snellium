# Serial Microcontroller Architecture

The main classes are implemented just as for the virtual microcontroller. I have `module.hpp` that is used by the module manager to attach the module into the daemon and `serial_configuration.hpp` which defines the program options needed to start the module.

The other classes are `serial_communication`and `serial_discoverer`. This classes implements the abstract classes of the module microcontroller and interact with `os_communication` and `os_discoverer` which are OS-specific classes encapsulating the libraries needed to exploit the serial communication interface.

The OS classes implements interfaces set at `microcontroller/os/` folder containing the base methods that must be implemented. The code is conditional compiled by the use of pre-compiler macros such as `#ifdef __linux__`. The implementation of this classes are set on their respective folder, `microcontroller-serial/linux` or `microcontroller-serial/win`, and they implement the same classes `OSCommunication` and `OSDiscoverer`. This classes are used by the serial classes to make the OS specific calls, since they interfaces the OS calls.
