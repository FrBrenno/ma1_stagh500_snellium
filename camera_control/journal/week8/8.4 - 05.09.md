# Today's Plan

- [x] Solve merge request threads as soon as they come
	- [x] Error checking to verify received message
- [ ] Continue implementing the virtual microcontroller module
	- [x] use typedefs instead of classes
	- [x] rename frontend to device
	- [ ] interface discoverer
	- [ ] Abstraction of Devices?? 
		- because camera and microcontroller has the same code
		- but how about modularity?
- [x] Documentation about microcontroller module doc/design/microcontroller
