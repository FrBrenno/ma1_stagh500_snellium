# Learning Outcommes

## Technical Skills

1. **Modular Software Architecture**:
    - I worked with a new type of architecture and had done many diagrams in order to understand how it works.
    - I was able to adapt my monolith prototype code to a already existing software 
    - I implemented my own modules, unit testing, integration testing and core classes to enable the use of my system.
2. **Communication Protocol Design**:
    - I designed and implemented a custom communication protocol for microcontroller interaction, using ASCII-based commands and responses.
    - I studied communication protocols in order to come up with my own simple version.
    - I worked with communication interfaces like USB and UART, learning how to handle different protocols efficiently.
3. **Microcontroller Firmware Development**:
    - I gained hands-on experience in writing firmware that handles command parsing, task execution, and error management.
    - I gained experience on understand embedded system IDEs, components and how to correctly configured them.
    - I was able to understand, explore and use a complete new IDE for a professional microcontroller for industrial uses.
4. **Component Selection**:
    - I made research on camera control systems and its hardware requirements.
    - I developed a methodology for selecting hardware components, focusing on reliability, industry orientation, and future scalability.
	- I was able to find a suitable microcontroller that meets the project requirements and is even possible to support many other features in the future.
5. **Version Control and Collaboration**:
    - I worked closely with my supervisor during code revision and get used to GitLab code collaboration environment.
    - I got experience on code convention, good practices and safety requirements during collaboration with technical director.
## Non-Technical Skills

1. **Project Management**:
    - I was able to manage the project properly and in a flexible manner without the need of harsh deadlines.
    - I worked with GanttProject to generate my gantt diagram to keep track of my advancement.
    - I used Kanban board to brainstorm my tasks and also, I used TO DO lists to managed by week-basis and day-basis workload.
2. **Problem-Solving**:
    - I tackled challenges like reducing code duplication through abstraction, resolving hardware-software integration issues, and optimizing system reliability.
    - I was confronted to make justified, reliable and critical choice of components for my project with vague ideas of the products and vague criteria.
3. **Collaboration and Communication**:
    - I worked closely with supervisors while developing the software for my system.
    - I discussed with my teammates for inspirations and ideas to solve my project problems.
    - I could communicated effectively in both technical discussions and formal settings, adapting to feedback and refining designs.
4. **Adaptability and Learning**:
    - I quickly adapted myself to new tools, platforms, and technologies, such as new software and microcontroller architectures, work environment, workflow, etc...
    - I was able to mitigate uncertainty in project scope and adapted designs to meet both current and future needs.
5. **Professional Growth**:
	- I could have a glimpse of how my career, my workday and workload will look like.
    - I understand the responsibilities and impact of my choices in the project.
6. **Autonomy**:
	- I demonstrated the ability to work independently without constantly asking for help.
7. **Proper Daily Workflow**:
	- I learned to implement a structured *daily workflow*, managing my time effectively despite a long commute and balancing work with exam preparation.
	- I learned that organization and being methodical ensures a clear overview of the project, that reduces stress and help on motivation. 
8. **Responsibility**:
	- I took on significant *responsibility* during the internship, particularly in tasks like selecting a microcontroller and proposing major architectural changes to reduce code duplication in an existing software. 
    - My decisions not only affected the current project but also had implications for future iterations, teaching me to carefully weigh my choices and justify them convincingly to my supervisor and team.
9. **Justification of Choices**:
    - One of the key learning outcomes of my internship was the ability to *justify my technical decisions*. I regularly communicated my reasoning behind selecting hardware, refactoring code, or proposing process changes. 
    - This ability to justify decisions with clear logic and technical knowledge has significantly improved my confidence in technical discussions.
10. **Confidence on myself**:
	 - I learned that having confidence on myself could help almost every aspect of my work. I could make better design choices and more clearly explain why something should not be done.
