# Today's Plan

- [x] Boost asio as pyudev - device monitor
- [ ] Start implementing c++ version
- [x] Ask for delivery date of USB-to-UART module
	- it should arrive today or tomorrow

# Boost asio - pyudev

- Someone says that enumerating available ports is a platform dependent task, which means that there is a library per OS or directly use OS calls to do it.
## Linux

- `libudev`, replaced by *sd-device*
	- API for enumerating and introspecting local devices

### libudev

- *Context* : track state and link objects together
- *udev_enumerate_new()* : enumerates local devices on the system
- *udev_monitor_new_from_netlink* : monitors the local system for hotplugged or unplugged devices

### sd-device

- provides an API to introspect and enumerate devices on the local system.
- part of a bigger library : `libsystemd`
- pretty difficult to use because there is no documentation but I did an example of code using it. Check file: `test_libsystemd.cpp`

**Steps to Implement on Linux:**
1. **Enumerating Serial Ports:**
    - Use `sd_device_enumerator` from the `sd-device` library to list all serial port devices.
    - Filter devices by subsystems like `"tty"` and `"usb"` to identify serial ports.
2. **Monitoring Serial Ports:**
    - Use `sd_device_monitor` to create a device monitor for detecting changes in serial ports.
    - Attach the monitor to an event loop using `sd_event_loop`.
    - Implement a callback function (`device_event_callback`) that handles device actions (e.g., device added or removed) and retrieves relevant device information.

## Windows

- Basically, we need to use the `SetupAPI`
- Here is the code of a sample project that should enumerate all devices.
	- First it connects to our computer and get the root node of the device tree.
	- Then, it enumerates installed devices by iterating through the tree.

**Steps to Implement on Windows:**

1. **Enumerating Serial Ports:**
	- Use Windows API functions `SetupDiGetClassDevs` and `SetupDiEnumDeviceInfo` to list all available serial ports.
    - Retrieve port names (e.g., "COM3") using the `PortName` registry value.
3. **Monitoring Serial Ports:**
	- Use `RegisterDeviceNotification` to receive notifications about device changes.
    - Handle `WM_DEVICECHANGE` messages in a Windows message loop to detect when a serial port is added or removed.
    - Re-enumerate ports upon device changes to update the list of available ports.
