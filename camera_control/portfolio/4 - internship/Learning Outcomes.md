    - Gained experience in implementing plug-and-play softwares
	    - Using discoverer threads, which scan communication interfaces and manage connected devices, contributing to real-time system responsiveness.
2. **Communication Protocol Design**:
    - Designed and implemented a custom communication protocol for microcontroller interaction, using ASCII-based commands and responses.
    - Understood the challenges of ensuring reliable data exchange between the microcontroller and daemon software.
    - Worked with communication interfaces like USB and UART, learning how to handle different protocols efficiently.
3. **Microcontroller Firmware Development**:
    - Gained hands-on experience in writing firmware that handles command parsing, task execution, and error management.
    - Gained experience on understand embedded system IDEs, components and how to correctly configured them.
    - Managed I/O operations and ensured proper synchronization between the microcontroller and the software system.
4. **Component Selection**:
    - Developed a methodology for selecting hardware components, focusing on reliability, industry orientation, and future scalability.
5. **Version Control and Collaboration**:
    - Enhanced familiarity with collaborative tools like Git, ensuring that code changes were tracked, reviewed, and integrated into the main codebase effectively.
    - Practiced maintaining code quality, readability, and following best practices in a professional development environment.

#### Non-Technical Skills

1. **Project Management**:
    - Managed a multi-phase project, from research and design to prototyping and final implementation.
    - Developed balancing short-term project goals with long-term requirements like future expansion.
2. **Problem-Solving**:
    - Tackled challenges like reducing code duplication through abstraction, resolving hardware-software integration issues, and optimizing system reliability.
3. **Collaboration and Communication**:
    - Worked closely with supervisors and others team members to align on project requirements.
    - Communicated effectively in both technical discussions and formal settings, adapting to feedback and refining designs.
4. **Adaptability and Learning**:
    - Quickly adapted to new tools, platforms, and technologies, such as new microcontroller architectures and communication protocols.
    - Learned to navigate uncertainty in project scope and adapted designs to meet both current and future needs.
5. **Professional Growth**:
    - Developed a deeper understanding of the professional software development lifecycle, from design to deployment.
    - Learned how to handle deadlines and deliver results in a real-world industrial setting.
6. **Autonomy**:
	- Demonstrated the ability to work independently, especially in designing the microcontroller communication protocol and the modular device architecture.
	- Took responsibility for researching and selecting microcontroller hardware, creating evaluation criteria, and presenting informed decisions to the team.
7. **Proper Daily Workflow**:
	- I learned to implement a structured *daily workflow*, managing my time effectively despite a long commute and balancing work with exam preparation.
	- By staying organized and prioritizing tasks, I ensured I could meet deadlines without compromising on the quality of my work.
8. **Responsibility**:
	- I took on significant *responsibility* during the internship, particularly in tasks like selecting a future-proof microcontroller and proposing architectural changes to reduce code duplication. 
    - My decisions not only affected the current project but also had implications for future iterations, teaching me to carefully weigh my choices and justify them convincingly to my supervisor and team.
9. **Justification of Choices**:
    - One of the key learning outcomes of my internship was the ability to *justify my technical decisions*. I regularly communicated my reasoning behind selecting hardware, refactoring code, or proposing process changes. 
    - This ability to justify decisions with clear logic and technical knowledge has significantly improved my confidence in technical discussions.
