# Today's Plan

I have find similar uC boards to the best ones I have chosen that has a shorter lead time until noon.

# Microcontroller choice

Since last time I have changed my research criteria and I has set more importance on short lead time (availability) and industrial applications.

My criteria list was :
- Industrial use: cited on an article or documentations its application
- Lead Time : < 12 weeks 
	- 12 weeks was the shortest lead time I had found so far
- Clock Frequency : > 80 MHz
	- a powerful microcontroller that could process data and/or perform a big load of calculations in future features.
- RTOS compatibility
	- For critical timing features that may be implemented in the future on this camera control module
	- I used FreeRTOS compatible devices for reference but if it was not really compatible I look to see if the manufacturer has its own RTOS
- Price Range: 22€ to 32€
	- Microcontrollers in this price range are excellent and more expensive boards has a lot of unnecessary features. Cheaper ones could be less powerful, restricting then the list of possible features.
- Reliability : 5/10 years
	- I looked for mentioned about reliability or lifetime.
- Number of GPIOs : >40 ports
- Architecture : ARM Cortex-M0, -MO+, -M3, -M4F, -M7
	- a powerful architecture for general multi-purpose industrial tasks.
- Ethernet comm. : available but not eliminating criteria
- PWM : preferably high but Ok for low
	- since the microcontroller may control the motion of the camera

I noticed that the lead time is strongly related to the manufacturer and not necessarily to the product. So, I tried to expand my "favorite", known for its industrial use products, manufacturer list. Different manufacturer has very different lead time. 

I was able to find two more options where one is particularly impressive for its abilities and short lead time. Renesas RTK5RX65N board has almost he same attributes of the last second best choice, Tiva EK-TM4C1294XL, which means it is pretty capable and has enough components to implement plenty of new features. Although the architecture type of the microprocessor is not a ARM Cortex-M, the documentations tells that the board is oriented for industrial automation and robotics.

I really think that this is the best choice due the criteria.

## Discussion with Vincent, Abbas

The microcontroller seems a good choice. It is robust, has a linux proprietary IDE, is compatible to RTOS, etc...

The only drawback it presents for the moment is no compatibility with Arduino Environment, meaning no libraries, and the need to solder components on it but the lead time of 4 weeks compensates all the negatives aspects.

Abbas just want me to make sure that development is easy and this board has a community support, in the case we run into problems in the future.

# Renesas RX65N review

To resume in a few important points:  
**_Pros_**  
- **Excellent construction quality.**
- **Easy Setup and Initial Impressions**
	- Quick start guide and pre-loaded demo apps facilitate setup.
	- Positive initial impression with well-documented features.
- **Firmware and Support**
	- Dual-bank flash memory allows seamless firmware updates and rollback.
	- Comprehensive e-Learning modules for the RX family of MCUs.
	- Active support forum with generally quick response times.
- **Development Tools**
	- e2Studio IDE based on widely-used Eclipse CDT, offering flexibility and plugin support.
	- Choice between CCRX (60-day free trial) and GCC (free) compilers.
	- Helpful utilities and sample programs aid development.
- **Smart Configurator**
	- Simplifies the configuration of FIT modules, ports, and pins.
	- Intuitive interface that accelerates development.
	- Significantly reduces the amount of handwritten code needed.
- **Value for Money**
	- Priced under £50, offering a cost-effective solution for HMI development.
	- Comprehensive set of features, including the MCU, LCD, debugger, and emWin software.

**_Cons_**  
- **User Fit Parts Issues**
	- Some parts are obsolete or difficult to source, causing potential roadblocks.
- **Segger emWin Software**
	- Initial setup is tricky due to limited documentation and outdated samples.
	- Requires adapting samples from other sources to work correctly.
- **USB/Serial Interface Challenges**
	- USB UART cannot be used for serial communication and debugging simultaneously.
	- Bug in the Serial Communications Interface FIT module remains unresolved.
- **Documentation is extensive and can be overwhelming (over 2700 pages).**
- **Board Design and Mounting**
	- No mounting points, making it difficult to encase the board.
	- Ports and headers positioned on the edge, limiting mounting options.
