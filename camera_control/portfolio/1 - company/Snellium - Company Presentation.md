<div style="text-align:center"> <h1>SNELLIUM</h1> <p>Innovative Solutions for Optical Inspections</p> </div>

Snellium is a startup and a spin-off from ULB, founded in 2021. It is an R&D company specializing in the development of **optical inspection systems** for the quality control of glass and plastic products in the automotive and aerospace industries.

The CEO of Snellium, Wassilis Tzevelecos, developed a technology during his PhD thesis that enables the quality control of glass manufacturing for aerospace applications. Recognizing the potential of this technology and with the help of external funding, he decided to start his own business with the current CTO, Vincent Van Pelt. A few years later, Abbas Lakkis joined the company as CPO. Together, they bring a wealth of expertise to the company—Wassilis manages both the scientific and business aspects, Vincent leads the IT and software projects, and Abbas coordinates mechanical designs as the product manager.

Currently, Snellium has six full-time employees, including the founders, along with a group of student interns. The company is very welcoming to students, each of whom is assigned a significant sub-project that contributes to a larger project.

## Business Model

Snellium operates primarily as a Research & Development firm. In an early conversation with the CEO, he explained that instead of focusing on a single product, they offer a flexible technology that can be implemented to meet client needs. Each client approaches them with a unique quality control challenge, and Snellium performs feasibility studies before signing contracts to implement their technology in the client’s context.

They own the core technology and, after delivering a project, they install it at the client’s site and provide ongoing maintenance. Clients then pay royalties for the use of the technology.

Snellium's main revenue sources include government subsidies for R&D, development contracts, and royalties from clients.

While their main focus is the automotive industry, their technology has a wide range of applications, including glass for mobile phones, watches, and buildings. The automotive sector is especially important due to its stringent requirements and the industry's drive to upgrade outdated systems and accelerate processes.

For example, my supervisor explained that current methods for profiling windshields involve mechanical systems using pistons. To calibrate these systems, technicians must use an expensive metal template that replicates a perfect windshield profile. Over time, these templates degrade, and the calibration process is slow and costly. Snellium’s technology offers a faster, cheaper, and more efficient solution to these problems.

## Technology

Snellium’s technology is fascinating, although it falls outside of my direct area of expertise. Here's a simplified explanation: they project a pattern, called a speckle, onto the object being analyzed, using a light source in front of a glass containing the pattern. A set of cameras, positioned at various angles, captures images of the object. Using stereoscopy, the technology reconstructs a 3D version of the object, extracts key pattern points, and analyzes any deformations by comparing the actual object to an expected computer-generated model. This allows for precise detection of manufacturing defects or deviations in the object’s profile.

Unlike traditional methods, Snellium's technology requires no calibration, templates, or pistons. Everything is optical, and the analysis is carried out by computer vision algorithms. Although the setup is still physically large, as it must support the glass, the only equipment needed is the cameras and the software. Profiling is completed in just a few minutes, providing a cost-effective, fast, and low-maintenance solution.


## Personal Opinion

I love the idea of innovation, and that’s exactly what Snellium is doing. They are providing innovative solutions for large industries that are constantly seeking better ways to improve their processes. Their standout feature is offering something that very few others do, and doing it exceptionally well. For me, this presents a significant opportunity, both from a technical and business perspective.

Technically, their technology is a major innovation that has the potential to transform how quality control is handled on production lines. What Snellium offers can save companies money, time, and improve product quality.

From a business standpoint, I believe they have enormous growth potential. With almost no direct competitors, they are in a strong position. The CEO mentioned that they have only one real competitor, a company based in Canada, but he is confident that Snellium's expertise and ongoing developments give them a significant edge. Being based in Europe is another major advantage, as many car manufacturers are located here. The market is vast, and they aren’t limited to just one industry—there are numerous sectors they can target.

Working here has been a much quieter and more flexible experience than I initially expected. While there are deadlines to meet, and projects are carefully managed to fit the schedule, once you receive the project brief, you are free to manage it in your own way, as long as you provide the necessary documentation and maintain a steady pace to meet objectives. The work environment is peaceful, though sometimes a bit too quiet. The only time when there are more lively conversations is during lunch, when everyone gathers around the table to chat. In my opinion, the only minor downside is the occasional social awkwardness when no one speaks. It may just be shyness, and I find myself guilty of it too at times.

Overall, I believe Snellium is a successful, innovative, and growing company with a bright future. Working here is calm and peaceful, the projects are engaging, and everyone is deeply involved.
